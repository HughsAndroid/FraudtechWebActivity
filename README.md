Fraudtech Web Activity

This is some of the code from my attempt at the project. I created the user interface but began to suffer burnout from the assessment and training program at the time I needed to write the server-side code, hence its brevity.

I was using a stack that resembled something like this:

Server OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
Database: MySQL Community
Web server: Node.js
Webpage is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript with BootStrap/JQuery
