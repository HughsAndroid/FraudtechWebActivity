Fraudtech Web Activity

This is some of the code from my attempt at the project. I created the user interface but began to suffer burnout from the assessment and training program at the time I needed to write the server-side code, hence its brevity.

I was using a stack that resembled something like this:

__Server OS__: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS  
__Database server__: MySQL Community  
__Web server__: Node.js  
The web pages are written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript with BootStrap/JQuery

I have much more experience creating web applications in C# and ASP.NET. My first-ever introduction to writing code was in HTML 4.0. Writing the web pages was a nostalgic experience, and from there, attempting to create a full web application from this stack was a great learning experience. I especially enjoyed setting the GNU/Linux server up, since I use Linux a lot for my personal computing.

Thanks for reading!
